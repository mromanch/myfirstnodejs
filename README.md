# My First Node.js Project

This is me, trying to learn a little bit about Node.js and development containers.

## Goals

1. A simple service to create random strings.
   - Takes a string length as an input parameter.
   - Defines a mechanism to allow user-defined character set and distribution rules, e.g., `allow-duplicates=false`.
2. Use development containers.
3. Github public repository, following best-practices for license, community health, contribution guide, CI/CD, etc...
4. Publish service to public endpoint.
